asset that ensures your fixed operations are able to perform efficiently and effectively. If it is not properly maintained, you risk inventory errors and challenges that will have an adverse effect on your entire business. That is why it is critical that dealerships maintain an accurate inventory - it helps improve your company\u2019s overall success.  The fact is, managing inventory is difficult for all businesses, especially large dealerships that have many people handling their parts inventory. While discrepancies are almost always going to occur, there are many ways you can minimize these differences and help ensure your inventory is as accurate as possible. 1. Don\u2019t Overlook the Importance of Good Warehouse Personnel Your department runs lean in personnel. It comes as no surprise then, that when a parts order arrives it\u2019s tempting to assume that the amounts received match the amounts ordered. That way you can quickly receive the stock and move onto the next task. Unfortunately, though, vendors make mistakes. To avoid this mistake, make sure your shipping and receiving clerk and warehouse staff are well trained. Most of the discrepancies in a physical inventory can be attributed to poorly trained staff. Before your staff put new parts on the shelves, have them verify that the numbers and quantities match the shipping receipts. Otherwise, your records will be inaccurate before the parts have even been handled by staff or sold to customers. 2. Store Your Parts Thoughtfully While it takes less time and thought to put new stock wherever you have space, considering where you put it can help reduce shortages and misplaced parts. Taking the time to create an effective inventory organization system and then ensuring it is implemented, and followed, can result in greater accuracy and it will, more than likely, have a positive effect on your productivity and dealership efficiency. 3.

By ensuring that you have implemented a simple and time saving process for managing returned parts, you can increase accuracy and decrease the number of parts that go missing or get misplaced. 4. Maintain Efficient Inventories Most manufacturers now have mandatory auto replenishment programs but, this does not mean that their programs don\u2019t need to be managed. Now, more than ever, it is critical that the person in charge of ordering manages these programs. As discussed above, inventory shortages can be detrimental and too much inventory is just as unfavorable as too little. Don\u2019t let the manufacturers dictate 100 per cent of your stocking levels. Take the time to review the turnover for each item and determine if you can cut back on the depth of in-stock items. Once you have done this, set minimum stock amounts that reflect the turnover and supplier lead time to minimize the likelihood of being caught without the item on hand. 5. Complete Regular Inventory Checks The more frequently you check your inventory, the easier it will be to spot errors and problem areas. This will, in turn, have a positive effect on your inventory records. If you are unable to check your entire stock, focus on the fastest moving items, special ordered parts and the highest valued parts. Take a couple bins each day throughout the year and check your accuracy. By doing so, you are able to identify the areas that your staff need more training on.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1580, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "230a3dc1-2ec7-4e90-ac3d-dbc4b3816902": {"__data__": {"id_": "230a3dc1-2ec7-4e90-ac3d-dbc4b3816902", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/skylerwilson/Desktop/PartsWise/co-pilot-v1/data/knowledge_database/accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 42988, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2b2a265-76ff-4fc3-a7b1-31e9268892b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/skylerwilson/Desktop/PartsWise/co-pilot-v1/data/knowledge_database/accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 42988, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "a80f9d35b2c987764159387580d19a132df112ef1e1a4953812ab61310af7608", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "227fdbb9-2d40-4ea1-a354-22da6e41e5a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "227fdbb9-2d40-4ea1-a354-22da6e41e5a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/skylerwilson/Desktop/PartsWise/co-pilot-v1/data/knowledge_database/accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 42988, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1699abb8-e202-4f91-ac3e-4cc080168ef3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/skylerwilson/Desktop/PartsWise/co-pilot-v1/data/knowledge_database/accurate_inventory.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 42988, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "20369cd34de400baa3974972751e564b76fb5c7d89944bec906963b92f8f9170", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If you know that there are some parts that never seem to match your records, take the time to check their levels more frequently. This will help you to identify problems as they occur, and hopefully identify the source and resolve the issue. 6. Controlled Access It's important to limit the number of individuals who have access to your dealership\u2019s inventory management system, and that the access level is regulated. Someone, who is not properly trained, could inadvertently change quantities and records or make an improper entry in your inventory system. By allowing access to a few well-trained individuals and requiring them to keep their login credentials private, you can minimize the risk of your inventory system being altered. 7. Have a Back-Up Plan These days, few things are done without the use of a computer or some sort of technology, including inventory management. While we happily depend on these technologies to help us with our day-to-day tasks, they are not always dependable. Maybe something is damaged, maybe it needs to be charged, maybe the electricity went out or maybe someone took it. Whatever the issue, having a manual process in place that can be implemented when your technology is unavailable will help ensure that you are equipped to maintain proper records.

Cash flow is a key indicator of your financial health. Anyone that has owned a business can attest -  it helps you manage debt, ensures that there are funds available for business growth and strategy development, and gives your dealership more flexibility. While it is safe to say that most people in the business world understand the benefits of cash flow, many of us are unaware of the importance that a well-performing inventory plays in the management of cash flow. Poorly managed cash flow is one of the biggest issues that businesses experience and the last thing you want to do is tie up valuable capital in inventory and slow-to-move parts. Measuring Performance Before solving your cash flow issues, with regards to inventory, you want to understand how your inventory is performing. To do so, there are couple inventory performance indicators you will want to consider. Inventory Turnover \u2013 This is the number of times per year that your inventory sells. There are a number of ways to calculate inventory turnover, however, a cost of goods sold to average inventory value at cost ratio is an accurate and popular measure. The higher your ratio, the better your automotive parts inventory is performing. In 2016, the average turnover for automotive parts & accessories was 4.8 times per year.  Be careful however, an inventory that turns too many times can indicate not having enough stock on the shelf and could cost you lost gross profit if you need to purchase locally. Order Turnaround Time \u2013 When looking at inventory, the amount of time that is takes to pick and receive the necessary parts for a customer or repair order is your turnaround time.

When looking at it in terms of your parts department, this rule states that 20% of your inventory produces 80% of your revenue. As such, it is critical that you manage groupings of parts in different ways. The first thing you want to do is identify parts that are quick moving. Often times these are less expensive, maintenance parts such as filters and brake pads and spark plugs. Individually, they may not be worth much, but when added together, you will quickly see that they bring in a substantial amount of revenue. You will want to stock more of these items. This will allow you to optimize turnover, while ensuring your capital is tied up in parts that you know will sell quickly. Depending on your situation, you may choose to order more of these items less frequently, or vice versa. Keep in mind, however, that lower inventory holding values can be beneficial and ordering more frequently will minimize obsolescence by ensuring you don\u2019t get stuck with parts that used to move quickly but no longer do.   The best way to determine how much of each should be kept in stock is to use historical data and trends. This will help you identify how much of these specific parts you use each month, quarter or year, allowing you optimize stock and economies of scale throughout the year.  Many manufacturers already have programs in place to do this for you. After this, you will organize the remainder of your parts by importance. Consider cost, turnover and lead times (how long it takes to get the inventory including ordering, shipping and receiving). You will want to keep these parts at more manageable levels and special order others on a case by case basis if the part is used with little frequency and ties up large amounts of capital. Once you understand which parts are most important, you will be able to better balance consumption with costs, ensuring your inventory stock levels and cash flow are optimized. Other ways to improve cash flow are to return your cores on a daily basis, keep up with manufacturer returns, take advantage of outside vendor programs, and most importantly, stay on top of your over aged parts.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2179, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d85465d-48e2-435d-aae8-49fc15827167": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d85465d-48e2-435d-aae8-49fc15827167", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "frozen_capital.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/skylerwilson/Desktop/PartsWise/co-pilot-v1/data/knowledge_database/frozen_capital.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 37062, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a54139b1-a471-459f-9319-b51a1a580057", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "frozen_capital.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/skylerwilson/Desktop/PartsWise/co-pilot-v1/data/knowledge_database/frozen_capital.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 37062, "creation_date": "2024-06-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-21"}, "hash": "5d16f2c9a2862d8574210cafd7f18e4e2e920e5c313d094095f44c7cadfa9d22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Special order parts if not watched closely will ruin a clean inventory very quickly.

Creating a systematic plan to identify and remove idle inventory is key to keeping things moving smoothly. In many cases, we find idle inventory originating from manufacturer programs. While they are typically guaranteeing these parts, some of them still end up in idle stock which takes up space, funds with holding costs, and wastes everyone's time. Here\u2019s how you can get ahead of idle inventory and build a plan for ongoing management.  Review parts ordered daily A daily review of all parts orders (including wholesale)  is essential to begin finding the root of idle inventory. You\u2019ll want to look especially closely at high-dollar items that are for a warranty repair and when multiple parts are ordered by the same technician. Many idle parts originate from warranty repairs that do not reach completion and techs ordering spec parts when uncertain about which is specifically needed.  Review open SOR report daily One of the main contributors to idle stock is incomplete customer repairs. By reviewing the \u2018SOR Report by Advisor\u2019 which is sent daily, you can keep a close tab on what is outstanding and find solutions to getting customers scheduled for repairs. If you haven\u2019t already, consider creating a specific commission-based position for follow-up on repairs or utilize your BDC to follow up and schedule repairs.  Run RPD (Report Prepaid Parts) at least once a week Review any returns from customers or technicians with a high dollar value and return eligibility. Ensuring all customer-pay parts on counter tickets and repair orders are pre-paid encourages customers to return and complete repairs.  Run monthly return routines Monthly, you\u2019ll want to check for and send back all ASR-guaranteed returns.

Calculating the amount needed monthly to purge will help you make a plan and get ahead. To calculate this, look at the monthly Technical Obsolescence average value. Then, find the monthly average of accrual earned to determine the accrual needed to reduce or maintain obsolete value. Review wholesale customers with high return percentages Wholesale customers can be a massive source of idle inventory from returns. It\u2019s important to ensure your wholesale customers are truly bringing value to your operation. To find high-return wholesale customers review the credit ranking report to see what wholesale customers are potentially abusing return privileges. Consider lowering discounts and/or charging a restocking fee to those who are high in return percentages, above 10%. Using a combination of all the above strategies will help to reduce the growth of idle inventory and reduce obsolete parts growth. Consistent daily reviews and monthly returns will go a long way in identifying the root cause of internal issues that are contributing to idle inventory.

For quite some time, the average for non-manufacturer guaranteed obsolescence hovered around 10-12%, but in recent years, it\u2019s trended upward towards 16-20% across the board. Dealing with parts obsolescence is just a part of the gig, but, with the right setups, monitoring, and DMS adaption, you can bring your obsolescence back down into a healthy range and address the root causes to prevent it going forward. Why is obsolescence growing? As with most things, increased obsolescence is often the result of many factors. The first thing we witness all too frequently is a lack of good clear reporting for PM\u2019s to even begin identifying how much of their inventory is idle inventory (excess, forced stock, technical obsolescence). To learn more about the categories of idle inventory and how to find your excess, forced and technical obsolescence stock, click here. Secondly, for many dealerships, a significant part of obsolescence comes into inventory through special orders. Special orders themselves are not the problem and are very much needed. Without them, inventories would have to be much larger, generating even more obsolescence. The real problem is special ordered parts that fail to make it to your customer and instead end up on your shelves. Download our free Special Order Process guide here. These parts are considered Forced Stock and can account for 30% or more of your on-hand, making up half of your obsolescence as it ages past the 12-month-no-sale mark. Another main contributor to obsolescence is automatic replenishment programs. While specifically designed to eliminate obsolescence for their dealers, many times these programs prove ineffective. We\u2019ve seen dealers relying on their Manufacturer Automatic Replenishment Programs on their way to having the highest obsolescence in the parts NOT managed by those programs. It\u2019s best to find the balance between meeting compliance and not stocking parts you don\u2019t need.  How to get rid of it After running reports to identify just how much idle inventory you\u2019re holding, it\u2019s crucial to remove this stock right away to maintain a healthy and long-term profitable inventory. To prevent accruing obsolescence coming from special orders, read more about them here. Selling obsolescence through a parts broker can get rid of some of those parts but often not all of them- you might end up with stock that really just won\u2019t sell. If your manufacturer is paying warranty retail, use some of that markup to throw obsolescence away. An accrual account for scrap can also work well.

Your DMS has the data needed to make decisions like this. Preventing obsolescence from coming back You can prevent your obsolescence from ever getting back up into the 20% range by setting up regular checks, optimizing DMS settings, and carefully leveraging your manufacturer program. Identify and track your technical, forced, and excess stock monthly and tweak your settings accordingly to prevent a future pile-up. Consider starting or adding more resources to selling parts online to have a consistent open market selling avenue. Make a plan for offsetting the inevitable obsolescence by taking a look at your Retail Matrix Escalators, profit margins on maintenance items, wholesale discounts, and pricing strategies to identify areas you can accrue more funds. Separating your non-guaranteed and guaranteed inventories in your aging report and viewing them as completely different inventories allows you to monitor what\u2019s going on in each class of your on-hand investment. That way you can make necessary changes in your process before parts obsolescence drags your whole operation down.

If your inventory is slow moving, this money will continue to stay tied up, giving you less money to invest in other areas of the business. Not only this, but the longer your parts inventory sits on the shelf, the more likely it is to become obsolete, decreasing the likelihood that you will be able to make back the money you have invested, possibly even losing it all together. The best way to determine how well your parts are moving, so that you can make the best decisions possible when it comes to investment and purchases, is to determine your inventory turnover ratio. You inventory turnover ratio shows how many time your parts are sold or replaced over time. To determine your inventory turnover, you need to divide your cost of goods sold (COGS) during the year by the average inventory value during the year. Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory Value Your COGS will be found on your income statement, whereas the average inventory will be calculated. To calculate average inventory, add your beginning and ending inventory balances for the year (found on your balance sheets) and divide the result by 2. Average Inventory Value = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 To determine how frequently your inventory turns, in terms of days, divide 365 days by the result of your inventory turnover ratio calculation. Days in Inventory = 365 days / Inventory Turnover Example - if you have $4,000,000 in COGS and an average inventory cost of $1,000,000 your inventory ratio would be 4 ($4 million / $1 million). That means that you turn over your inventory every 91.25 days (365 / 4).

To effectively evaluate your inventory turnover ratio, you should compare it to past ratios within your company, future goals and the average industry turnover. In 2017, the average inventory turnover for auto parts and accessories was 3.8, according to The Retail Owners Institute. Downfalls of Inventory Turnover While your inventory turnover ratio can offer a number of insights into your ability to sell parts quickly and to fulfill customer\u2019s orders, it does have some qualifiers. The most common of which is that the inventory turnover ratio is calculating the average turnover of ALL your parts. As a result, a favorable overall inventory ratio does not mean that you are free and clear of excess parts and obsolescence. When turnover is too high, you run the risk that you may have too few parts on the shelf.  When this happens, you must purchase the parts on an emergency basis, many times paying more for that part than you would have if you would have purchased it from the manufacturer or jobber. Example - You have a COGS of $4 million and an average inventory cost of $1 million. However, 5 parts account for 40% of the sales but only 10% of the average inventory cost. This would mean that your inventory turnover for these specific parts would be 16 (($4 million x 40%) / ($1 million x 10%)) and that these parts turn every 22.81 days. The remaining 60% of the inventory would have an inventory ratio of 2.67 (($4 million x 60%) / ($1 million x 90%)) and are turning, on average, every 136.7 days.

What is a lost sale? A lost sale happens every time you lose an opportunity to sell a part, whether it be over the phone, over the counter, or in the Service Department, the profit (parts & labor) walks out the door with the customer.

Understanding Gross Profit: Gross profit, calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from total sales revenue, is a fundamental measure of the Parts Department\u2019s profitability. It reflects the department\u2019s ability to manage costs effectively while maximizing revenue from parts sales. 2. Evaluating Operating Income: Operating income, another crucial financial metric, is determined by deducting all operating expenses from the gross profit. It represents the efficiency of the Parts Department in generating profit from its operations. Operating income is expressed as a percentage of total revenue, providing a clear picture of the department\u2019s financial health. 3. Comparative Analysis Across Dealerships: Financial worksheets allow for a side-by-side comparison of these metrics across different dealerships. This comparison helps identify best practices and areas for improvement. For instance, dealerships with operating incomes above 30% are generally considered high performers, while those below 10% may need to scrutinize their operations for inefficiencies. Factors Influencing Financial Performance \u2022 Examining the differences in financial performance can uncover various factors influencing profitability, such as sales strategies, expense management, and local market conditions. \u2022 Understanding the nuances behind these numbers is crucial for making informed decisions and implementing strategies that enhance the department\u2019s profitability. 4.8: The Impact of Inventory Age on Profitability The age of parts in inventory is a critical factor affecting both the sales potential and profitability of the Parts Department.

Reduced Sales Potential: Parts that remain unsold in inventory for extended periods (over 6 months) significantly lose their likelihood of being sold. The probability of selling an aged part decreases over time, with a nearly negligible chance of sale after 12 months. 2. Financial Implications: Aging inventory can tie up capital and result in increased holding costs. It also represents a missed opportunity for revenue generation, as these parts occupy space that could be utilized for more in-demand items. 3. Inventory Turnover Rate: A key metric here is the inventory turnover rate, which indicates how frequently parts are sold and replaced over a given period. A lower turnover rate often points to aging inventory and inefficiencies in stock management. Strategies for Managing Aging Inventory \u2022 Regularly reviewing and adjusting inventory levels to ensure that stock aligns with current demand trends. \u2022 Implementing promotional strategies or discounts to move older stock. \u2022 Using inventory management systems to track and analyze sales patterns, helping to predict demand and avoid overstocking of slow-moving items. In conclusion, understanding the financial metrics of gross profit and operating income is crucial for evaluating the performance of dealership Parts Departments.

This inventory collects dust, takes up valuable warehouse space, and ties up capital that could be better used for more productive assets. New product launches and upgrades can instantly turn older models into relics no one wants. Changing consumer preferences and lightning-fast trends can quickly make hot-selling products obsolete. Excess inventory ordered during periods of overly optimistic demand forecasting can become boat anchors when the tides of demand suddenly shift. In this article, we dive into the problem of obsolete inventory. We\u2019ll examine its common causes, the financial and operational challenges it creates, and strategies companies can use to identify and deal with obsolete stock. What is obsolete inventory? Obsolete inventory, also known as dead inventory or excess inventory, consists of products that are no longer useful for sale. Obsolete inventory includes outdated technology models, expired food or pharmaceuticals, items damaged in transit, products that failed quality control, overruns of promotional giveaways, and excess seasonal merchandise. Accumulating obsolete inventory occupies physical warehouse space and ties up capital unproductively.  The liquidation of obsolete stock frees up square footage for faster-moving products. It also unlocks cash invested in unsaleable goods to reinvest in marketable inventory aligned with current consumer trends and demands. Intentionally disposing of nonperforming inventory improves operational efficiency and overall profitability.

Proper inventory management and planning for these product transitions through promotions and liquidations can minimize leftover obsolete stock. Staying on top of product life cycles is key to avoiding inventory write-downs. Changes in consumer preferences Changing consumer tastes and rapidly evolving trends can quickly turn hot-selling products into outdated duds, taking up warehouse space. Regularly reviewing sales velocities, assessing market trends, and conducting market research allows businesses to identify declining demand and efficiently adjust inventory and production levels. Product damage or deterioration Inventory items susceptible to damage or natural deterioration over time can expire or become unsellable. Implement procedures to identify and rotate perishable stock and protect items from damage to avoid obsolescence and waste. Monitoring stock conditions ensures that your products are of the highest quality and have sales potential. Poor demand forecasting Inaccurate demand projections directly lead to excess inventory and obsolete stock buildup. Leveraging historical sales data, marketing input, and market trends improves forecasting accuracy to prevent over-ordering. Use predictive analytics tools that can support better demand planning to minimize obsolete inventory. Ineffective inventory management A lack of visibility into inventory levels and movement can result in obsolete items accumulating undetected.

Here\u2019s how retail businesses can identify obsolete inventory: 1. Review sales reports Often, the first sign of obsolete inventory is a drop in sales. For instance, if winter jackets aren\u2019t selling well throughout the peak season, it\u2019s a strong indication they might become obsolete.  To catch this early, use your inventory management software to track product sales over time, specifically targeting items with consistently low or declining sales. 2. Check expiration dates Products in certain retail sectors, such as cosmetics, have a limited shelf life. For example, a batch of sunscreen might be nearing its expiration date. Rather than wait for the product to expire and become obsolete, use your inventory management system to set alerts for items approaching expiration dates.  This proactive approach allows you to take action, such as selling the batch of sunscreen at a discount. 3. Inspect stock condition Some products may become unsellable due to physical deterioration. T-shirts may not have an expiration date, but they can fade if exposed to prolonged sunlight, which decreases their market value, potentially making them obsolete inventory. To prevent this, schedule regular stock condition checks. 4. Compare to purchase orders Another effective way to spot obsolete inventory is by comparing current stock to recent purchase orders.

Obsolete auto parts inventory typically just occupies valuable space and ties up capital. The positive news is, there are actionable steps you can take to tackle surplus and obsolescence, ultimately driving your profitability. Here are 6 best practices that you can implement to improve operational efficiency at your dealership. #1 Better Understand the Issue Begin by pinpointing problematic inventory. Compile a list of parts consistently overstocked, items frequently sold at a discount, and those prone to obsolescence. Then, assess each SKU's turnover rate, delivery times, profit margins, and storage costs. This analysis helps weigh the cost of inventory against the risk of obsolescence, highlighting areas needing attention. #2 Start with Quick-win Solutions For auto parts overstock with low sales prospects, the solution often involves disposal, though not necessarily discarding them outright. Explore options such as selling to customers or other service providers, disassembling for reuse, reaching out to neighboring dealerships, utilizing return programs from manufacturers, or using them for training purposes. #3 Address Operational Inventory Issues Rather than solely monitoring for obsolescence, it's crucial to address underlying inventory management problems. Common issues include overly optimistic sales forecasts, communication gaps between departments, technological shifts, vendor challenges, inaccurate records, and inadequate planning. Identifying and rectifying these issues is important for long-term efficiency. #4 Develop Long-Term Solutions Inventory management is prone to errors, particularly during peak seasons.

Inventory cost is not simply the unit cost of the item, but includes all of the items listed above as well.  Now that we have properly identified a company\u2019s true cost of inventory, we can analyze how to reduce that cost. Companies typically use rough estimates to figure out their cost of inventory. As we have shown above, the standard rule of thumb is roughly 30% of inventory value on hand. More importantly, managing idle parts represents 3% of that cost. This is not to be confused with dead stock. Idle stock can be defined as products that have a strong sales history, albeit cyclical, but suddenly stop selling and remain in inventory for extended periods.

Finding ways to limit the impact of this cost will help your bottom line. The Blanket Order / Kan Ban Hybrid is an ideal way to accomplish this by ensuring the agreements with your suppliers limit your lead times. Blanket\tOrder\t/\tKanban\tHybrid\tStrategy Under this type of agreement your supplier will maintain an agreed upon finished product inventory for you. These are products that are completely packaged and ready to ship. Your supplier will also maintain semi-finished product ready to replenish the finished product inventory, thereby minimizing your future stock replenishment time. A good rule of thumb is a 2:3 ratio. This will account for any unforeseen spikes in demand.  The time needed to convert the semi-finished product inventory into finished product inventory should be no more than a week. When negotiating inventory volumes you should try and come as close to your supplier\u2019s EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) as possible. This is the volume whereby any additional amount ordered, does not lower their costs or your price. It may not be possible to always reach this amount, but discussing it up front with your supplier will help open the door to lower pricing. Purchasing one widget at a time for ten straight days will never be as cost effective as ordering ten widgets in a single shipment. \tWHAT\tDOES\tA\tBLANKET\tORDER/KANBAN\tHYBRID\tAGREEMENT\tMEAN\tFOR\tYOUR\tCOMPANY? 1)\tYou\tmust\tcommit\tto\ta\tfixed\tquantity\tof\tfinished\tproduct\tinventory\tfor\teach\tshipment.
